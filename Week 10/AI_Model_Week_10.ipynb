            "(c) a instigates b to set fire to a dwelling-house. b, in consequence of his unsoundness of mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of a’s instigation. b has committed no offence, but a is guilty of offence. (d) a, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates b to take property belonging to z out of z’s possession. a induces b to believe that the property belongs to a. b takes the property out of z’s possession, in good faith, believing it to be a’s property. b, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. but a is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the explanation 4.—the abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence. explanation 5.—it is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. it is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. for murder. 47. abetment in india of offences outside india.—a person abets an offence within the meaning of this sanhita who, in india, abets the commission of any act without and beyond india which would constitute an offence if committed in india. committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this sanhita for the explanation.—an act or offence is said to be committed in consequence of abetment, when it is committed in consequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment. (b) a and b conspire to poison z. a, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to b in order that he may administer it to z. b, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to z in a’s absence and thereby causes z’s death. here b is guilty of murder. a is guilty of abetting that abettor.—whoever abets the commission of an offence shall, if the person abetted does the act with a the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the abettor and with no other. 51. liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—when an act is abetted and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if he had directly abetted it: provided that the act done was a probable consequence of the abetment, and was committed under the influence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment.
